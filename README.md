haxe php pthreads
===============
_Haxe extern definitions for php pthreads._

### About

A bunch of extern definitions for php pthreads extension. Nothing is tested and some things are incomplete as we are
only using the definitions for other extern libs. Feel free to contribute your changes to make the library more complete.

### Installation

Make sure you're running a build php that has the pthreads v3.x extension enabled, then:

Install the library for your dev env:
```bash
$ haxelib install haxe-php-pthreads
```

Add library to your build files:
```hxml
--library php-haxe-pthreads
```
